# soajs release

SOAJS follows the fish names as release names

We also push patches per release that are numbered like Kanuy 4, Kanuy 5, â€¦

Each release or patch might affect several repositories and each source code has its own semantic version and each microservice has its own version.

### Complete Documentation
